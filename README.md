You can run 'Server Host Script.py' to begin hosting servers off your local device, just make sure you have port 80 forwarded! Make sure to run the script inside the directory you have all your websites stored, as it'll search that directory when a incoming connection sends a GET request.

Other than the server host script, included in this repository are many different examples of various .html websites, and their associated files.
